  content: `Free People, a specialty women’s clothing brand, is the destination for bohemian fashion that features the latest trends and vintage collections for women who live free through fashion, art, music, and travel. The brand offers a wide range of products from apparel (think: jeans, leather jackets, sweaters, crop tops, maxi skirts and more), to accessories, outerwear, shoes, intimates, swimwear, activewear, and beauty – all reflecting a high level of quality, invoking attributes of femininity, spirit, and creativity in its design, while creating the perfect festival clothing. Known for its playful femininity, the brand is a destination for party dresses, black dresses, wrap dresses, minis and maxis.

    More than a clothing brand, Free People aims to create a lifestyle that’s inclusive and sincere. Whether it’s bespoke experiences or philanthropic efforts, they revel in celebrating their fiercely loyal community. Free People is distributed globally via direct channels, including the Free People Global site, the Free People UK site and the Free People Chinese site, as well as specialty clothing boutiques, top department stores, the brand’s free-standing retail locations (in the U.S, Canada and, now, Amsterdam!) and the Free People Apple iOS mobile app. We offer free standard shipping on orders $100+ in the US, and ship orders to over 100 countries worldwide, including Canada and Australia. Gift cards are also available.`,
